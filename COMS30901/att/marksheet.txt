1. Instructions

- replace any [...] with free text,
  and
- replace the [?] with an X if you have completed that stage,
- replace the [?] with an * if you have attempted that stage, but you know
  it doesn't work completely; document why you think it doesn't work, plus
  what you would do to fix the problem, at the end of the marksheet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Information

So that we can calibrate and improve the assignment in the future, give us
a rough idea how long (in hours) you spent on it *in total*:

effort : [...] hours

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Citation

Clearly it might have an influence on your mark, but the use of third-party
resources *is* allowed *if* correctly cited (unless explicitly prohibited 
by the assignment description of course).  Let us know what third-party 
source code or resources you used (if any) so it's clear what's your work 
and what isn't:

[...]

4. Marking

The following gives a stage-by-stage description of the assignment marking
scheme.  Note this acts as an indicative guideline only, including weights
for each more obvious element (e.g., the functional correctness of a stage).
For example, other elements outside this list *often* warrant an increase
or decrease in marks; examples include hard to quantify features such as
the style or efficiency of a solution.

[X] Stage 1 : an attack based on error messages

              - correct target material                              ( 40%)
              - solution quality wrt. efficiency, robustness etc.    ( 40%)
              - analysis questions                                   ( 20%)

              target material : [
	        Recovered plaintext m (hexadecimal):
	        9ed07f8e8e230664f1d343a64e83df0d39a72869b62e6626f30cf453ac29c3bd8fe62d9ec3a15ff8b9327d03a4e96e24296e36ea44a170f229bee934e1fdd481a975e841f9ea42521b8cdddb977b879d46552574e8d5670cacb3ecd33a94448168215a304b10640a21ceaf79ef3f57c0b4a34bea615052b5a2e991a43e8ab
                Recovered secret s (hexadecimal):

              ]

[X] Stage 2 : an attack based on execution time

              - correct target material                              ( 40%)
              - solution quality wrt. efficiency, robustness etc.    ( 40%)
              - analysis questions                                   ( 20%)

              target material : [
	        Recovered private key d (hexadecimal):
		ef1be81543f99433
	      ]

[?] Stage 3 : an attack based on an injected fault

              - correct target material                              ( 40%)
              - solution quality wrt. efficiency, robustness etc.    ( 40%)
              - analysis questions                                   ( 20%)

              target material : [...]

[?] Stage 4 : an attack based on power consumption

              - correct target material                              ( 40%)
              - solution quality wrt. efficiency, robustness etc.    ( 40%)
              - analysis questions                                   ( 20%)

              target material : [...]
                                                                     ------
                                                                     (400%)

5. Documentation

Any other documentation, notes or comments that you think are important or
might be easy to overlook (e.g., a subtle issue or technique in associated
source code) should go here:

[
 I have implemented my attacks in python, both in files named attack.py.
 Provided these files are marked as executable, they can be invoked simply using
 ./attack.py <Command to invoke D> <Path to params file>. For example:
 ./attack.py ./56626.D 56626.param
