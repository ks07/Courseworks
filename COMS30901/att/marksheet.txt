1. Instructions

- replace any [...] with free text,
  and
- replace the [?] with an X if you have completed that stage,
- replace the [?] with an * if you have attempted that stage, but you know
  it doesn't work completely; document why you think it doesn't work, plus
  what you would do to fix the problem, at the end of the marksheet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Information

So that we can calibrate and improve the assignment in the future, give us
a rough idea how long (in hours) you spent on it *in total*:

effort : [68+67] hours

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Citation

Clearly it might have an influence on your mark, but the use of third-party
resources *is* allowed *if* correctly cited (unless explicitly prohibited 
by the assignment description of course).  Let us know what third-party 
source code or resources you used (if any) so it's clear what's your work 
and what isn't:

[
 Target interaction code (python) from the worksheets.
 Some other miscellaneous functions and constants are attributed inline in the source code.

4. Marking

The following gives a stage-by-stage description of the assignment marking
scheme.  Note this acts as an indicative guideline only, including weights
for each more obvious element (e.g., the functional correctness of a stage).
For example, other elements outside this list *often* warrant an increase
or decrease in marks; examples include hard to quantify features such as
the style or efficiency of a solution.

[X] Stage 1 : an attack based on error messages

              - correct target material                              ( 40%)
              - solution quality wrt. efficiency, robustness etc.    ( 40%)
              - analysis questions                                   ( 20%)

5. Documentation

Any other documentation, notes or comments that you think are important or
might be easy to overlook (e.g., a subtle issue or technique in associated
source code) should go here:

[
 I have implemented my attacks in python, both in files named attack.py.
 Provided these files are marked as executable, they can be invoked simply using
 ./attack.py <Command to invoke D>. For example:
 ./attack.py ./56626.D
 
 Of special note in Stage 3, the fault attack, is that my implementation
 contains both a one-fault and two-fault implementation. The two fault
 implementation is ran by default. The one fault implementation can be ran by
 setting the relevant parameter to the attack function. Unfortunately, I did not
 have time to optimise/parallelise my one fault attack, thus the second stage
 does not complete within the execution time limit. I have however tested it
 with a severeley restricted output from stage 1 (both with and without the
 correct key bytes present), and it appears to be correct.
