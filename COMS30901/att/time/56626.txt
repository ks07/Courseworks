Q.1 The vendor of the attack target is concerned that news of this attack
    could scare off potential customers; they will make any alteration
    necessary (in software or hardware) to prevent the attack.  Explain the
    options they have, and which one you would recommend.
Q.2 Let n denote the number of simulated clock cycles required to execute a
    Montgomery multiplication on the attack target.  Estimate the value of
    n (as accurately as you can) and explain how you did so.
Q.7 Numerous factors might produce noise within measurements of execution
    time: based on the given attack target and context, outline at least
    two examples.
Q.6 You were provided with a replica of the attack target.  If you used it,
    explain how; if not, explain why, and how you could do so given more
    time.
