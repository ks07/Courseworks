Q.1 Consider an example where N = 551, e = 5, d = 101 and c = 243.  Using
    your own words, briefly explain and illustrate the working principle of
    this attack (i.e., how and why it works).
Q.2 To prevent the attack, the vendor suggests altering the software: the
    idea is that no matter what error occurs, the same error code will be
    produced.  Explain whether (and why, or why not) this change alone is
    sufficient.
Q.4 This attack is based on the fact that decrypting a ciphertext of the
    form c = (f^e)*c' mod N produces a plaintext of the form f*m' mod N.
    Show why this fact is true.
Q.5 Explain how the concept of plaintext awareness relates to this attack.
