Neuron Pos Plot
================

1. Majority of firings concentrated around C1, not at C2. Why? Maybe this is a "Place Cell" in the hippocampus, with a place field around C1.

2. Majority of firings in the central corridor after having made the turn that informs future choice. Perhaps neuron 2 is related
   to making the decision based on recalling the previous turn?

3. ???

4. A lot more spread, but concentrated at the left turn from F1 to the central arm. There is very little activity on the mirrored
   turn coming from F2, so it seems likely this neuron is related to the left turning motion. There is not a significant
   concentration near other left turns (e.g. at the end of the central arm, headed towards to C1). This shows that perhaps neuron
   4 is related to remembering the forced left turn needed to make the later choice, instead of left turns in general.

======================
Neuron Auto Corr Plot
======================

Might show underlying frequencies in spike train. E.g. most neurons appear to spike in 0.1s intervals. Like a noisy sine wave.

=======================
Neuron Cross Corr Plot
=======================

Diagonal shows the auto corr. As expected, much higher auto correlation than cross. More spikes for the later neurons so graphs scale.

CC(2,1) : Some spikes at 0.5 second delay.

CC(4,1), CC(4,2), CC(4,3) : Little correlation, not much variation between the lowest and highest peaks.
