\subsection*{Neuron Firing Positions}

  \label{fig:posplot}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:posplot} shows the locations in which each neuron was most
active across multiple tests. The first neuron is active almost exclusively in
the upper right region of the maze, which suggests that this neuron is a place
cell. Place cells become active when an animal enters a corresponding place
field, but are otherwise relatively inactive. Place cells together are thought
to provide spatial processing. Neurons 2 and 4 appear to be closely
related. Neuron 2's activity is focused in the central arm of the maze. This
suggests it is involved with spatial or working memory; this neuron appears to
be involved in the recall process required to inform the choice made at the end
of the central arm. This conclusion is backed up by the activity of neuron 4,
that is most common at the end of the central arm and into the upper choice
arm. Neuron 4's apparent preference of the top arm suggests it is involved in
the decision process, using the information recalled by the second neuron. It
would be beneficial to find a corresponding neuron that showed a preference for
the opposite direction, to backup this hypothesis. Unfortunately, the function
of neuron 3 is not clear from these plots.

%% \vspace{5mm}
%% The excitatory synaptic connection plot in figure \ref{fig:sub1} shows that the time between spikes quickly converges. This is because when one neuron spikes, the post-synaptic neuron experiences an increase of voltage. Converseley, the inhibitory synaptic connection in figure \ref{fig:sub2} shows that the spiking frequencies become out of phase. This is due to the post-synaptic potential decreasing. In both cases, the effect is compounded as the neurons spike, causing the effect to become more pronounced (until the neurons are either completely in or out of phase, respectively.
