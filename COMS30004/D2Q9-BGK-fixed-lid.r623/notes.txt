OPENMP Coursework Notes
=======================

1) Compile using tau and run to get profiler results.

Total runtime unoptimised: 4:03.525
Slowest function is collision()

2) Modify collision() to stop recomputing curr_cell

New time is 3:53.237

3) Collision again, directional velocity

This was stupid, slower. 3:54.088

4) See the effect when switching to -O3

Much much faster, 1:51.143

5) Try naiive parallel for in collision

Down to 38.661s

6) Try adding omp_set_nested(1)

At 38.586 - negligible

7)
