In this program you will have to implement a simple phonebook
application which allows you to input phone numbers and then print
them out as a list ordered by name. The program should be writen in c
and, since each stage supercedes the previous one, you should just
send one program that performs the highest stage achieved.

1. Make a program that reads from standard input a name (no spaces
allowed) and a phone number (again no space allowed). When the name
that your program reads is a "." , then you should stop and print out
the list of names and phone numbers. If the executable is called a.out if should look something like this when it is running: 
% a.out
Muller 01179545137 
LZ 01179545136
Lewis 01179545138 
BR 0845484950 
NASA +19876543210
. 

BR 0845484950 
LZ 01179545136
Lewis 0117955138 
Muller 0117945137 
NASA +19876543210 
%

Please also note that the expected input will be name space number. 
Up to 40%

2. Change the program so that it ignores the case when it is
alphabetizing so LZ comes after Lewis.
Up to 55% 

3. Change the program so that if a name is entered more than once (ie,
a person has more than one phone number), all phone numbers are
printed in one line after the name. This includes names that differ
only in case, if there are more than one version of any name it should
print out the name with just the first letter capitalized. As an example

% a.out
Muller 01179545137 
muller 01179545136
MULLER 0854584950
zack 198754321
zack 198754322
. 
Muller 0117945137 01179545136 0854584950
zack 198754321 198754322
%

So, since Muller is given in different versions, it prints it out with
the first letter in capitals, but zack is given both times the same
way, so it keeps it as zack.

Up to 70%

4. Change the program so that it gives an option to ask for a range to
print out. Something like

Do you want to print all entries y/n? n 
First entry? Lee
Last entry? Zeb 
Lewis 0117955138 
LZ 01179545136
Muller 0117945137 
NASA +19876543210

Up to 85%


5. Change the program so it also has a lookup mode, if you finish by
pressing ! instead of . then it should return the phone number
corresponding to the next name you enter. It should find the entry
using binary search. As an example.

% a.out
Muller 01179545137 
LZ 01179545136
Lewis 01179545138 
BR 0845484950 
NASA +19876543210
! 
What name? NASA 
+19876543210 
%

Where it has writen "What name?" and the user has inputted "NASA", the program replies with the number for NASA.

If the overall data structure is something more advanced than an
array, it is not required that you use binary search.

Up to 100%
